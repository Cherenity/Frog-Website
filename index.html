      <h1> Frog Facts </h1>
      <br>
      <p> In a pond so green and bright, Hops a frog with all its might. 
      <br>It leaps and jumps with a playful groove.
      <br><br> Its croak echoes through the night, A sound that brings pure delight.
      <br> With every leap, it catches flies,
      And basks in the moonlit skies.</p>

When temperatures drop, some frogs dig burrows underground or in the mud at the bottom of ponds. They hibernate in these burrows until spring, completely still and scarcely breathing."

The bulging eyes of most frogs allow them to see in front, to the sides, and partially behind them. When a frog swallows food, it pulls its eyes down into the roof of its mouth, to help push the food down its throat."
